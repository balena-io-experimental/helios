    - subject: Add target state overrides system
      hash: 1a0f59afa629b820fb35eaa374cf6ea23b123da2
      body: |
        Implement app-specific configuration overrides that read `override.json`
        files from /mnt/temp/apps/{app-uuid}/ and apply them to target state.
        Includes comprehensive test coverage and dependency injection for
        file system operations.

    - subject: Implement target state caching and interception in proxy
      hash: b2b5b3c79d0e8d10ea8d34116bae3255439bdea2
      body: |
        Intercept /v3/device/{uuid}/state requests from legacy supervisor
        and serve from locally cached target state instead of proxying
        to remote API. Returns 503 with Retry-After: 15 when no target
        state is cached yet.

    - subject: Add uplink service for target state polling
      hash: 2ac811d6f4f1317b52e2cc9f4d06d9b3aaebd9d9
      body: >
        Implement UplinkService that polls target state from the API and
        notifies

        subscribers of changes. Includes jitter for load balancing, manual fetch

        triggers, and comprehensive error handling.


        - Add rand dependency for jitter calculation

        - Create link module with uplink service implementation

        - Add max_jitter_delay_ms configuration option

        - Integrate uplink service into main application flow

        - Add extensive test coverage for polling, updates, and error scenarios

        Introduce new request module with comprehensive HTTP client
        capabilities including GET/POST methods, JSON handling,
        error management, and timeout configuration. Add reqwest
        and related networking dependencies to support external
        API communication and data fetching operations.
